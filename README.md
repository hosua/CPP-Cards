# CPP-Cards
Text-based card game engine in C++

Currently, I have made a small war game demo as an example of how an implementation using the engine may look. You can test it out by compiling Examples/wardemo.cpp, and running the binary.

This is currently a work in progress, so currently it won't have any documentation. I will document it once I finalize everything.
